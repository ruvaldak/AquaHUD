# AquaHUD
A simplistic, modern UI resource pack designed to complement Sodium's UI.

## About
Upon installing sodium, I immediately found it rather annoying that it's user interface was completely different from the rest of Minecraft's. So, I took it upon myself to create a resource pack that attempts to complement Sodium's user interface in a way that makes every screen feel consistent and like it was meant to look that way. This has been in development for quite a while, so there may be some inconsistencies with some UIs.

## Want something more faithful to sodium's style?
[AquaHUD Flat](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/aquahud-flat) is AquaHUD but with:
 * no grids
 * no hard exterior outlines
 * more seperation between elements

## Permissions
do whatever, i dont care

## Requirements
The only requirement is my [TranslucencyFix](https://modrinth.com/mod/translucencyfix) mod.

## Recommendations
Ready for the cool stuff? Me too.

 * Sodium: https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium
 * Sodium Extra: https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium-extra
 * Blur: https://modrinth.com/mod/blur-fabric
 * 'Slight' Gui Modifications: https://modrinth.com/mod/slight-gui-modifications
 * OneBar: https://modrinth.com/mod/onebar
 * Using Optifabric? Custom Background Color instead of Blur: https://modrinth.com/mod/r1ifqLkv/version/XQhFC2Zk

      * Why? Because LibGUI hardcodes damn near half of it's GUIs and I can't do anything about it.
