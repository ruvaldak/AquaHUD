# AquaHUD
A simplistic, modern UI resource pack designed to complement Sodium's UI.

## About
Upon installing sodium, I immediately found it rather annoying that it's user interface was completely different from the rest of Minecraft's. So, I took it upon myself to create a resource pack that attempts to complement Sodium's user interface in a way that makes every screen feel consistent and like it was meant to look that way. This has been in development for quite a while, so there may be some inconsistencies with some UIs.

## Permissions
This project uses the CC BY-NC-ND License.

See [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/ruvaldak/AquaHUD/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for more information.

## Pull Requests
I will look at any pull request submitted to AquaHUD, but pull requests will only be considered if you:
 * Follow the general design philosophy of AquaHUD and Sodium's UI.
 * Explain your changes thoroughly
 * Explain why you think your change should be considered (i.e. what's wrong with the original, and why yours is better)

## Requirements
The only requirement is [my SemiTranslucency mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/semitranslucency). It is supported on Forge 1.16.5 and Fabric 1.16 - 1.19. It will not be backported, so don't ask.

IF YOU DO NOT USE SEMITRANSLUCENCY, THE PACK WILL NOT LOOK ANYWHERE NEAR AS INTENDED. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE ANY SUPPORT IF YOU DO NOT USE IT.

## Bugs, Errors, and Suggestions
Use the Issues tab here on AquaHUD's GitHub. I'll immediately close anything posted on Issues that isn't:
 * Clearly explained or described
 * In some form of English (Google Translate is okay)
 * An actual bug, error, or suggestion.

Examples of issues that will be immediately closed:
 * How do I install fabric?
 * What is semitranslucency?

GitHub Issues is not for tech support. No exceptions.
