# AquaHUD/Flat
A simplistic, modern UI resource pack designed to match Sodium's UI.

## What makes AquaHUD/Flat different from normal AquaHUD?
AquaHUD Flat is AquaHUD but with:
 * no grids
 * no hard exterior outlines
 * more seperation between elements

## About
Upon installing sodium, I immediately found it rather annoying that it's user interface was completely different from the rest of Minecraft's. So, I took it upon myself to create a resource pack that attempts to complement Sodium's user interface in a way that makes every screen feel consistent and like it was meant to look that way. This has been in development for quite a while, so there may be some inconsistencies with some UIs.

## Permissions
do whatever, i dont care

## Requirements
The only requirement is [my TranslucencyFix mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/translucencyfix).
